# English-vs-Dutch-text-classification

**Overview**

This project aims to build a text classification model capable of determining whether a given text is written in English or Dutch to enhance language understanding and generation capabilities.

**Steps**

**1. Business Understanding**

Research Question: Create a model to classify text as English or Dutch.

Success Metric: Achieve at least 85% accuracy.

Context: Work involves developing language models to improve natural language processing capabilities.

Experimental Design: Includes understanding the business problem, exploring data, preparing data, modeling, summarizing findings, and recommendations, and addressing challenges.

**2. Data Importation**

Import data using libraries like pandas.

**3. Data Exploration**

Explore the dataset to understand structure and content.

**4. Data Preparation**

Cleaning: Remove irrelevant data and format.

Text Cleaning: Preprocess text for analysis.

Feature Engineering: Generate features using techniques like TF-IDF.

**5. Data Modeling**

Train and evaluate classification models (e.g., Random Forest) to determine the best performer.

**6. Summary and Recommendation**

Summary: Evaluate model performance.

Recommendation: Improve by increasing sample size, tuning hyperparameters, and enhancing feature engineering.

**7. Challenging the Solution**

Right Question? Yes.

Right Data? Yes.

Improvements: Consider larger sample size, hyperparameter tuning, and advanced feature engineering.
